# Project 0003: RISC-V to ARM64 JIT Runtime ðŸ“‹

### Overview
Implementation of a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler runtime that translates RISC-V machine code to native ARM64 instructions and executes them. This enables running RISC-V programs directly on ARM64 hardware with near-native performance.

## TODO
Detailed tasks and design considerations to be specified later.
