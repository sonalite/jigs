# Project 0004: Execution Gas Tracking Runtime ðŸ“‹

### Overview
Implementation of a gas/points-based execution tracking system for RISC-V programs. Each RISC-V instruction consumes a certain amount of "points" (gas) when executed, with a configurable maximum limit. This enables controlled execution environments with resource limits for use in blockchain virtual machines.

## TODO
Detailed tasks and design considerations to be specified later.
