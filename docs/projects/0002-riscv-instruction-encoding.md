  - Shift instructions (SLLI, SRLI, SRAI): 0 to 31 range for shamt field

### Current Test Structure

- `src/tests/instruction/display/`: Display formatting tests (unchanged)

### Key Learnings
- Helper functions like `encode_r_type()` should be placed at the bottom of the file
- Roundtrip tests eliminate duplication between encode and decode test suites
- Test organization should mirror instruction types (register/, immediate/, etc.)
- All instruction variants must derive `Debug`, `Clone`, and `PartialEq` for testing
- EncodeError should implement std::error::Error and std::fmt::Display traits for proper error handling
- **IMPORTANT**: When implementing encoding for an instruction, remove only the decode test functions that are covered by roundtrip tests (e.g., in `src/tests/instruction/decode/register/sub.rs`, remove functions like `basic()`, `zero_registers()`, etc. when adding `src/tests/instruction/roundtrip/register/sub.rs`). Keep any decode failure tests that aren't covered by roundtrip. If no tests remain in the file after removal, delete the file and update the mod.rs
- All R-type instructions follow the same encoding pattern using `encode_r_type()` with appropriate funct3 and funct7 values
- Test migration strategy: As each instruction type gets encoding support, its decode tests are replaced with roundtrip tests that verify both encode and decode operations
- **Register Bounds Checking**: The `encode_r_type()` function validates that all register values (rd, rs1, rs2) are within the valid range (0-31) and returns `InvalidRegister` error with the register name and invalid value if out of bounds
- **Immediate Bounds Checking**: The `encode_i_type()` function validates that immediate values are within the valid range for I-type instructions (-2048 to 2047) and returns `InvalidImmediate` error with the field name and invalid value if out of bounds
- **Comprehensive Error Testing**: Each instruction needs bounds checking tests for all applicable fields (registers and immediates) to ensure 100% code coverage

### Final Test Structure Review Considerations
When all encoding is complete, review the test structure for:
- **Consistency**: Ensure all instruction types follow the same organizational pattern
- **Discoverability**: Tests should be easy to find based on instruction name or type
- **Maintainability**: Consider consolidating directories if decode/ becomes mostly empty
- **Naming**: Ensure test function names are consistent and descriptive
- **Coverage**: Verify edge cases and error conditions are adequately tested
- **Documentation**: Add README files to test directories explaining the organization
- Potential reorganization options:
  - Keep roundtrip/ as primary test location, move remaining decode tests there
  - Organize by instruction format (R, I, S, B, U, J) vs functionality
  - Consider whether encode/unimplemented.rs tests are still needed

## Design Considerations

### Encoding Strategy
- Each instruction variant implements its own encoding logic
- Immediate values are validated to ensure they fit within bit width constraints

### Error Handling
- Return Result<u32, EncodeError> to handle invalid immediate values
- Provide clear error messages for out-of-range immediates
- Always use Result for error handling, never panic

### Testing Approach
- Modify existing decode tests to test bidirectionally using a shared helper function
- The helper should: decode the instruction word, verify it matches expected, encode it back, verify it matches original word
- Every encoded instruction should decode back to the original
- Test boundary values for all immediate fields
- Verify against known instruction encodings from RISC-V spec
